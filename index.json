The performance of crowd counting has been greatly boosted with the rapid development of deep learning. However, robust crowd counting in high-density environment with scale variations remains under-explored. To address this problem, we propose a dual attention-aware network (\\(\\hbox {DA}^2\\)Net) for robust crowd counting in dense crowd scene with scale variations. Specifically, the \\(\\hbox {DA}^2\\)Net consists of two modules, namely Spatial Attention (SA) module and Channel Attention (CA) module. The SA module focuses on the spatial dependencies in the whole feature map to locate the heads accurately. The CA module attempts to handle the relations between channel maps and highlights the discriminative information in specific channels. Thus, it alleviates the mistaken estimation for background regions. The interactions between SA module and CA module provide the synergy which facilitates the learning of discriminative features with a focus on the essential head region. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets, i.e., ShanghaiTech, UCF_CC_50, UCF-QNRF, WorldExpo’10, and NWPU, demonstrate that the \\(\\hbox {DA}^2\\)Net can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on both accuracy and robustness.","tags":[],"title":"DA 2 Net: a dual attention-aware network for robust crowd counting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jun Jiang","Xinyue Wang","Mingliang Gao","Jinfeng Pan","Chengyuan Zhao","Jia Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1642204800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642204800,"objectID":"f0ef6a383aacc559d14d97b4527235c5","permalink":"https://brighten.group/publication/journal-article-23/","publishdate":"2022-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article-23/","section":"publication","summary":"The goal of abnormal behavior detection is to detect an anomalous event in video as accurate as possible. Motion information is crucial in such case as an inadequate motion estimation can easily make it worse. In this work,an abnormal event detection method was proposed to detect the occurrence of an anomaly automatically by using generative adversarial network (GAN) and streak flow acceleration. The proposed method is mainly composed of two components (1) GAN-based framework that feeds on motion patterns to detect abnormal events, and (2) explicitly modeling motion information by incorporating streak flow acceleration. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified on public benchmarks and comparative results show that our method performs favorably against many state-of-the-art
